* Gobble

Boggle game.

** Currently

+ [[file:garcon/][garcon]] - game server
+ [[file:nibble/][nibble]] - nix expressions to get running on the network

** Previously

Previously, other languages did the solving. Now, there's a simpler
structure where haskell does it all. Here are the former solvers,
factored out:

+ [[https://github.com/jitwit/cobble][cobble]] - scheme boggle solver
+ [[https://github.com/jitwit/joggle][joggle]] - J boggle solver

The scheme one is the fastest, but the J one is the most fun.
