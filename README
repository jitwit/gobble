* Gobble

Boggle game.

** Currently

+ [[file:garcon/][garcon]] - haskell websocket server
+ [[file:nibble/][nibble]] - nix expressions to get on the network

** Previously

Previously, the haskell code was responsible only for games,
generating and solving boards was either left to scheme or J. Now,
there's a more sensible structure, in which haskell does it all. Here
here are the old parts factored out:

+ [[https://github.com/jitwit/cobble][cobble]] - scheme boggle solver
+ [[https://github.com/jitwit/joggle][joggle]] - J boggle solver

The scheme one is the fastest (of the three), but the J one is my
favorite one.
