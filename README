* Gobble

Boggle game.

** Currently

+ [[file:garcon/][garcon]] - haskell websocket server
+ [[file:nibble/][nibble]] - nix expressions to get on the network

** Previously

Before, the haskell code was responsible just for games, not for
generating and solving boards. Now there's a more sensible structure,
but here are the old parts factored out:

+ [[https://github.com/jitwit/cobble][cobble]] - scheme boggle solver
+ [[https://github.com/jitwit/joggle][joggle]] - J boggle solver

The scheme one is the fastest, though the J one is my preferred
solver.
