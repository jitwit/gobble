Boggle on the net. 

+ [[file:cobble/][cobble]] - scheme libraries including tries, dictionaries, and the
  boggle sovler. script to generate boards
+ [[file:garcon/][garcon]] - haskell servant web server and websocket server to actually
  run games
+ [[file:joggle/][joggle]] - J script that also solves boggle boards. it loads much
  faster than the scheme program, but solves slower
+ [[file:nibble/][nibble]] - nix expressions to get it all going in the _cloud_
